<h1 id="SubSectionCircuitChecker">Circuit Checker</h1>
<p>The circuit has to follow these conditions:</p>
<p>Condition 1: Circuit must begin and end with a tank.</p>
<p>Condition 2: Circuit can have only two tanks.</p>
<p>Condition 3: Second element must be a horizontal pipe.</p>
<p>Condition 4: There should only be one pump in the circuit.</p>
<p>Condition 5: All the pipes and bends should have the same diameter.</p>
<p>Condition 6: Succeeding pipes should have the same angle.</p>
<p>Condition 7: Bends should be preceeded and succeeded by pipes except before the final tank.</p>
<p>Condition 8: Pumps should be preceeded and succeeded by horizontal pipes.</p>
<p>Condition 9: Filters must be preceeded and succeeded by horizontal pipes.</p>
<p>Condition 10: Valve must be preceeded and succeeded by pipes of same angle.</p>
