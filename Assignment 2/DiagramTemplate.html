<h1 id="Introduction">TPK 4186 Assignment 2</h1>
<p>This page provides a report of the assessment of the risk done on the new control system for the subsea plant.</p>
<p>The flow diagram representing the activities to be followed is given below.</p>

<p>Summary of the activities done</p>
<ul>
<li> A <a href="#SubSectionModelChecker">checker</a> was created to assess the design of the model after parsing the model from the given xml file.</li>
<br>
<li> Monte-Carlo Simulation was then performed to find the different <a href="#SubSectionMonteCarloSimulation">statistics</a> of the total duration.</li>
<br>
<li> In addition machine learning techniques like <a href="#SubSectionClassification">classification</a> and <a href="#SubSectionRegression">regression</a> are also applied to raise alerts.</li>
<br>
<li> A <a href="#SubSectionConclusion"> Inference </a> of the performance of these techniques are also assessed.
<br>


</ul>


<h1 id="SectionModelElements">Model Elements</h1>
<p>The elements in the models are given below</p>

__MODEL__

<h1 id="SubSectionModelChecker">Model checker</h1>
<p>The model has to follow these conditions:</p>
<p>Condition 1: There is one and only one node with no predecessor and this node is a gate.</p>
<p>Condition 2: There is one and only one node with no successor, and this node is a gate.</p>


__CHECKER__

<h1 id="SubSectionMonteCarloSimulation">Monte Carlo Simulation Statistics</h1>

<p>This section shows the summary of the different statistics computed from the simulation.</p>

__STATISTICS__
<br>
<br>
<img src="Histogram.png" alt="The histogram for the simulation performed" width="700" height="400">
<br>
<br>
<h1 id="SubSectionClassification">Classification</h1>

<p>Three different classification algorithms have been used to assess if the project will exceed 3 different maximum dates.</p>

__CLASSIFICATION__


<h1 id="SubSectionRegression">Regression</h1>

<p>Three different regression algorithms have been used to assess the risk of the project.</p>

__REGRESSION__

<h1 id="SubSectionConclusion">Inference</h1>
<p>As can be seen from the data above, the performance of the machine learning algorithm varies depending on different factors.When the maximum date is not too close to the mean, 
<br>the classification technique gives good results (around 90% ). 
<br>
<br>The regression models yields around 70% accuracy, except for the K-neighbours regressor technique (with n = 5) which yields the lowest.</p>
